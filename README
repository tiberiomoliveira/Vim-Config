VIM like an IDE
===============

I try to get together the more useful plugins for vim and find a way to install then easyly.

The plugins are:
  - Snipmate
  - Syntastic
  - NerdTree
  - NerdTree Tabs
  - Simple Pairs
  - Easytags
  - Miscellaneous Autoload

To download the plugins and install the files, you just have to run 'make'. You need to change the variable INSTALL_PATH inside the Makefile in order to enter the right home path.
