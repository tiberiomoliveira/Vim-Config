VIM like an IDE
===============

I try to get together the more useful plugins for vim and find a way to install then easyly.

The plugins are:
  - MiniBufExpl
  - SnipMate
  - Syntastic
  - NerdTree
  - Simple Pairs
  - Clang Complete
  - SuperTab

HINT:

To play well with SuperTab plugin, the snipMate plugin needs a little adjustment. The thing is that snipMate has a snippet pattern, that turns a dot into brackets []. Which is bad when you type a dot and then hit <Tab> to autocomplete with SuperTab.
  "myclass."
turns to:
  "myclass[]"
To fix this, the snipMate/snippets/c.snippets file needs to be changed from:
  snippet .
      [${1}]${2}
to:
  # snippet .
  #     [${1}]${2}
